# Mario-2D-CSS

Mario 2D using HTML5 & CSS3. This is just an experiment to experience 2D art using Css. 

## What it looks like?

<img src="./resources/images/mario.png" alt="Mario" width="200" >

## Next

1. I want to create a library which can be used to create any 2D image using Grid and JS.
2. I will be writing a reactJS application to handle all the colors dynamically.
